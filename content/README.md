Invasive species 
Stop the invasion 
Save the ecosystem 
What are invasive species?
Invasive species are organisms that are not native to the environment. These organisms are brought into a new area where they have very little competition. Because of this they are able to reproduce quickly and outcompete other native species. 
Why is this bad?
Picture this: In an island there are a group of birds, mice, and fruit plants. The birds eats the mice and the mice eats the fruit plants. Back where you live, you find a few endangered cats. You see remember the island that you visited last summer had a lot of mice so you brought the few endangered cats over so they can eat some mice and have a better chance of surviving. (picture) 
Now The cats are happy. They have all the mice they can eat and better yet, there is no pretor to eat them. The few cats you brought are so comfortable in their new environment they decide reproduce. A few cats become dozens and  dozens  become hundreds (picture) 
  Now the ecosystem that was once balanced, is completely thrown off. 
The cats are now starting to become overpopulated because they have they have unlimited food and no other organism that could possibly kill them.
 The bird population is starting to become extinct because the cats are eating all their food
 The mice population is starting to rapidly decrease because the cats are eating them all 
 now that there is no mice the fruit plants don’t have a pray and they are starting to become over populated.
Examples of invasive species
Cane toad: 
Native origin: North & south America, Central America, and Mexico 
  Introduced to: Countries with warm climates such as Australia
How they got here: Brought over to control crop pests 
Why are they a problem?: The cane toad produces a toxic ooze that predators in the native habitat has become immune to. Predators in the cane toads new habitat are not. This results in any animal who tries to eat the toad to die.
North pacific sea star:
Native origin: Waters around china Japan and Korea 
Introduced to: Australia
How did they get here: They attached themself to boats and fishing equipment that was coming over to Australia 
Why are they a problem: These Starfish eat almost anything they find. They also reproduce very rapidly. They caused the endangerment of the spotted handfish.
Chestnut blight: 
Native origin: Asia  
Introduced to: North America  
How did it get here: Infected chestnut seeds were brought to America. 
Why is this a problem?: The fungus the seeds were infected with caused sores on chestnut trees, cutting off nutrients and eventually killing all of the chestnut trees in america.   
What you can do to prevent the spread of invasive species: 
Don’t bring fruits, vegetables, plants, insects, or animals into foreign places.
Always clean your boots before hiking in order to get rid of hitchhiking weed seeds and pathogens. 
Do not release any fish plants or exotic animals into the wild. 
Educate others on the dangers of invasive species.
