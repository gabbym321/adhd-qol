                        species.

                    <p class="section-paragraph">In an island there are a group of birds, mice, and fruit plants. The birds eats the mice and the mice eats the fruit plants. Back where you live, you find a few endangered cats. You remember the island that you visited last summer
                        had a lot of mice so you brought the few endangered cats over so they can eat some mice and have a better chance of surviving.</p>

                        Now The cats are happy. They have all the mice they can eat and better yet, there is no pretor to eat them. The few cats you brought are so comfortable in their new environment they decide reproduce. A few cats become dozens and dozens become hundreds.

                        Now the ecosystem that was once balanced, is completely thrown off.
<li>The cats are now starting to become overpopulated because they have they have unlimited food and no other organism that could possibly kill them.</li>
<li>The bird population is starting to become extinct because the cats are eating all their food. </li>
<li>The mice population is starting to rapidly decrease because the cats are eating them all. </li> 
<li>Now that there is no mice the fruit plants don’t have a pray and they are starting to become over populated. </li>

How they got here: Brought over to control crop pests <br>
<strong>Why are they a problem?: </strong>The cane toad produces a toxic ooze that predators in the native habitat has become immune to. Predators in the cane toads new habitat are not. This results in any animal who tries to eat the toad to die. <br>
