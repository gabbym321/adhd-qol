One studentâ€™s IEP could look totally different than the nexts. All public schools have this program in place; this is covered by the Special Education Law. Obtaining an IEP is a large process. This begins with an evaluation to check if the student qualifies, while also measuring their strengths and weaknesses. An IEP can stay with a student up until college; with yearly meetings, reports and evaluation checking up on the progress and making any adjustments needed to the IEP.

          <p class=section-paragraph> 504 plans are blueprints that public schools make in order to insure that students with disabilities are getting the same rights as others. This is covered under section 504 of Rehabilitation act, which is a civil rights law. What a 504 plan does is give students special accommodations such as extended time on tests or smaller class sizes. There is many ways to qualify for a 504 plan. Often schools look at multiple sources. For example they might do a medical diagnosis, check grades and ask for teacher recommendations. Unlike an IEP, a full evaluation is not required.

Although there are systems in public schools that help students with ADHD and other disabilities, these programs are often difficult to get into and work more on accommodating the needs of the student rather than helping them with skill work. <br> <br>
What I plan on creating is a class where students with ADHD or who inhibit symptoms of sort can go to and work on skills that they may have a hard time with due to these symptoms. Some skill work may include: organization, attentiveness, techniques to deal with impulsivity, and more. <br> <br>
Students who are not apart of the class but who excel academically can come in to speak with the class about techniques they found that helps them and struggles they also face in school. <br> <br>
Lastly, studies have shown that 64% of indivisuals with ADHD have another disorder such as depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and more. It has been proven that psychotherapy is an effective way of dealing with these disorders; therefore, I plan to have guidance counselors come in weekly and do both private and group psychotherapy.
