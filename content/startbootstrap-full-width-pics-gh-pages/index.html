                        species.

                        had a lot of mice so you brought the few endangered cats over so they can eat some mice and have a better chance of surviving.</p>

                        The bird population is starting to become extinct because the cats are eating all their food <br> *The mice population is starting to rapidly decrease because the cats are eating them all <br> *Now that there is no mice, the fruit

  Introduced to: Countries with warm climates such as Australia
How they got here: Brought over to control crop pests <br>
Why are they a problem?: The cane toad produces a toxic ooze that predators in the native habitat has become immune to. Predators in the cane toads new habitat are not. This results in any animal who tries to eat the toad to die.
